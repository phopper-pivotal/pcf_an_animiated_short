# Pivotal Cloud Foundry 
## An 101 for Application Developers and Operators
During this workshop you will gain a deeper understanding of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, its components and architecture, how to deploy an application, how to create a service and bind to an application and day 1 and day 2 operations of an application. 

Whether your apps are staying on-premises or moving to a public cloud, these principles will help you build more scalable, resilient and adaptable systems that drive your competitive advantage.

You’ll leave this workshop with a better understanding of what you need for Day 1 deployment, Day 2 operations and beyond. If you’d like to read up on Cloud Foundry feel free. But don’t worry, we’ll do an engaging deep dive together.
